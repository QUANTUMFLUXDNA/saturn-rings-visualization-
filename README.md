# Saturn's Rings: Spin-Orbit Resonances Visualization

An interactive 3D visualization of Saturn's rings that demonstrates the cosmic dance of gravity, chaos, and orbital resonances. This educational tool allows users to explore the relationship between Saturn's moons and the structure of its iconic rings.


## Features

- **Interactive 3D Model**: Fully rotatable and zoomable visualization of Saturn and its ring system
- **Ring Composition Analysis**: View the material composition of different ring regions:
  - Water ice (90-95%)
  - Silicates (1-2%)
  - Organic compounds (2-5%)
  - Iron oxide (trace amounts)
- **Particle Size Visualization**: See how particle sizes vary across the rings, from microscopic dust to house-sized chunks
- **Resonance Simulator**: Interactive simulation showing how orbital resonances with moons create gaps and structures in the rings
- **Moon Integration**: View Saturn's moons and understand their gravitational influence on the rings

## The Science Behind Saturn's Rings

Saturn's rings are a natural laboratory for studying celestial mechanics and thermodynamics. The rings consist mainly of ice particles ranging from micrometers to several meters in size, orbiting Saturn in accordance with Kepler's laws.

### Key Resonance Features

1. **Cassini Division**: Created by the 2:1 resonance with Mimas - particles here orbit exactly half as fast as Mimas, causing them to receive regular gravitational "kicks" that clear out this region
2. **Encke Gap**: Maintained by the moon Pan, which orbits within the gap and shepherds ring particles away
3. **Keeler Gap**: Created by the small moon Daphnis, which also creates characteristic wavy patterns at the gap edges

### Composition Details

The rings are primarily composed of water ice, giving them their bright appearance. Spectroscopic studies from the Cassini mission revealed small amounts of silicates, organic compounds, and iron oxide. This visualization accurately represents the varying composition across different ring regions.
